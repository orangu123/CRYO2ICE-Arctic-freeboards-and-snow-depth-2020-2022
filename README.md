# CRYO2ICE radar/laser freeboards, snow depth on sea ice and comparison against auxiliary data during winter season 2020-2021 (version 1)
 A first examination of CRYO2ICE (CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2) freeboards (radar or laser), derived snow depths, and comparison auxiliary data (daily snow depth maps from passive microwave or reanalysis-based models, and buoys) during the winter season (November-April) of 2020-2021. 
 This program computes CRYO2ICE comparable observations at CryoSat-2 locations (baseline) by a defined search radius using the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Baseline-D L1B and L2 products for CryoSat-2 and ATL10 from NASA's ICESat-2. These are later compared with freeboard products from ESA's CLimate Change Initiative (CCI+) and the lognormal altimetric re-tracker model (LARM, Landy et al. 2021), to investigate impact of different re-trackers, as well as daily snow depth maps from passive microwave (AMSR2/ASMR-E) and reanalysis-based snow models (SnowModel-Lagrangian/SMLG and an updated version of this SMLG-HS).

### Installation and about the code 
The code is written in Jupyter Notebook and requires various python packages which are shown in the top cell of the repositories. These packages can be installed using either ```pip install``` or ```conda install``` in your command/prompt window. 

## Processing steps 


### Pre-processing of CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2



### Obtaining CRYO2ICE observations: extract ICESat-2 at CryoSat-2 locations with specified search radius 



### Extract auxiliary data: AMSR2, SM-LG and additional CryoSat-2 re-trackers for comparison


### Buoy comparison
