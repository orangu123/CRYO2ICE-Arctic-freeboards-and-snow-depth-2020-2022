# CRYO2ICE radar/laser freeboards, snow depth on sea ice and comparison against auxiliary data during winter seasons 2020-2022 v3.0
 A first examination of CRYO2ICE (CryoSat-2 and ICESat-2) freeboards (radar or laser), derived snow depths, and comparison auxiliary data (daily snow depth maps from passive microwave or reanalysis-based models, and buoys) during the winter season (November-April) of 2020-2022. 
 This program computes CRYO2ICE comparable observations at CryoSat-2 locations (used as baseline) by a defined search radius using the European Space Agency's (ESA's) Baseline-E  L2 products for CryoSat-2 and ATL10 r005 from NASA's ICESat-2. These are later compared with freeboard products from ESA's CLimate Change Initiative (CCI+) and the lognormal altimetric re-tracker model (LARM, Landy et al. 2021), to investigate impact of different re-trackers, as well as daily snow depth maps from passive microwave (AMSR2/ASMR-E) and reanalysis-based snow models (SnowModel-Lagrangian/SMLG).

### Installation and about the code 
The code is written in Jupyter Notebook or in python, and requires various python packages which are denoted in the CRYO2ICE_environment.yml file. These packages can be installed and activated when creating a conda environment using the .yml file. 

## Open research
This github is compiled of several Jupyter Notebooks used to compute the data and produce the study presented in: Fredensborg Hansen et al. (2024). Data compiled and used for the study is presented in: DOI 10.11583/DTU.21369129
